## Full description:  
When you have many apps installed on your phone it can be difficult to find the one that you actually want. We've noticed an increase in productivity since we've started typing up the app that we want, as opposed to visually looking for it.

TypeUp prevents the dopamine-induced opening of time-wasting apps.

Prior to using this app, if we wanted to open a work-related app, we would unintentionally notice a social media app, then dopamine would be released because our brain enjoys those apps and the next thing you know is that you've been wasting hours on social media, which have hacked your physiology, without you even knowing it.

\- How to prevent this?  
By having a home screen without addictive apps (basically, every app is addictive and your brain wants to open it when you see the app icon). So, now you can use TypeUp to open the app you were actually going to open, without being distracted. You can still have addictive apps if you hide them from your home screen and use TypeUp to access them. This way, you'll have to think before typing up, which is beneficial because you won't build muscle memory, which is a major driver of unconscious actions. This has huge benefits on productivity and self-control.

Depending on your system version, we recommend that you disable the default app gallery (a list of apps with icons) that you would normally use by swiping up or doing something similar that would cause you to open apps unconsciously.

This is a non-commercial app, and we simply want to share it with the rest of the world. TypeUp is designed to be simple, minimalistic and to launch quickly. Also, TypeUp label (app name in the launcher) is blank in order to keep the home screen minimalistic. 

## How to use?    
Just download and type up the name of the app you want to open.  

## What about Privacy?  
We do NOT track, save, or share the searches you make or the apps you use. You are completely cut off from the rest of the world.
